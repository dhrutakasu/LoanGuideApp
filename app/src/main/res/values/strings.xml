    <string name="AadhaarQue1">An Aadhaar card loanfinance is a type of unsecured financing option provided by the banks to its customers. It requires minimum documentation as compared to traditional bank loans.  Aadhaar card  is a paperless e-KYC document that fulfills your eligibility criteria for biometric verification. It can be used for your ID proof and address proof.  You just need to submit your financial documents such as salary statements, PAN Card, bank statements for approval of your aadhaar loanfinance.</string>
    <string name="AadhaarQue2">A loanfinance can be used to meet any unfortunate circumstances such as – medical expenses, renovation of a house, child’s education or marriage expenditures, etc. If you are planning to apply for a aadhaar loanfinance, it’s compulsory to submit your Know Your Customer (KYC) documents. The government has made it mandatory for banks and financial institutions to collect KYC details from the applicants in order to prevent money laundering. Banks have started e-KYC which has made the process much easy and simple. Since Aadhaar contains biometric data of the individuals, verification process has become fast.\n\nEarlier, both private and public sector banks demanded several documents from the applicants in order to approve aadhaar loanfinance application. Hence, the time taken for approval was also long. However, ever since the Aadhaar cards have been introduced, lesser documents are required, and the time taken for the loanfinance approval has reduced.\n\n\t aadhaar loans are generally taken for emergency purposes such as medical expenses or for funding education, and Aadhaar makes the process quick.  aadhaar details of the individual are found in the Aadhaar database; therefore, the time taken to get the loanfinance approved is less.</string>
